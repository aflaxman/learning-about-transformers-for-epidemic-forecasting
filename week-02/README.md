# Week 2: Time Series Fundamentals - Mini Project

## Mini-Project: Flu Forecasting with ARIMA

### ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

1. **Download influenza data from [Project Tycho](https://www.tycho.pitt.edu/){:target="_blank"  rel="noopener"}**
2. **Fit ARIMA model to one state's data**
3. **Make 4-week ahead forecasts**

## ðŸ““ Notebooks
